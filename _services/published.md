not a lot of projects have made here. unlike a lot of companies, we're open to failure. we learn from them, and as a company we cannot aspire to be good if we don't fail in the process.

we think of you as not only as an employee but also an _engineer_. an engineer who keeps on creating to survive. 
so, as a company, we keep on creating!

## The process

we want to make sure we have a new project once every three months, so a the longetivity of this process shall not be too long so you don't get bored about your project
although for a lot of startups, the object is to stay in the black, ours is to amaze people. 

- pass the thought process
- come up with designs
- write documentation, your future plans
- publish it _within_ the company
- debug debug debug
- publish to the open public

so far **1** project has been on this category. _yours_ can be the second.

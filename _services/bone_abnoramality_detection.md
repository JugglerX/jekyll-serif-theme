## Research Problem

Currently there are no viable solutions for the web based medical images viewing systems that also run computer aided systems that can diagnose or identify potential problems with the medical images. Even though I mainly focused on the detection using X-ray images this technique can be improved and updated for other techniques such as MRIs and ultrasound images. Current situation is that most of the work is done by a radiologist or a physician for the diagnosis part of the procedure. Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are the systems that are currently in use in countries like Sri lanka. They only provide a way to view the medical images by the radiologist  and do not provide any helpful diagnosis prediction on behalf of the medical practitioner. And PACS solves the problem of having to manually transfer the medical images from the capturing device to the computer that has the viewing software. With the lack of human and technical resources it is vital to get most out of the resources available in hand. Due to this, there should be a mechanism for managing the available medical resources well so that every patient who does need the attention gets it whether they are in a city, town or rural village. 
Detection of bone abnormalities in humans using X-rays is the problem that I am focusing on. It is important because it is overlooked most of the time due to the rarity of a diagnosis event. Most of the time bone abnormalities detection has been diagnosed accidently. I could make every bone X-ray go through a model and automatically inform the radiologist if any irregularities were found about the X-ray. There are several ways for the detection of bone abnormalities such as SVM model and deep learning using CNN model. Most of the models give a relatively similar rate of a prediction of the abnormality. I have to incorporate these models with a view for the radiologist.

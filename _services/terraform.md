Define, Write, Plan, and Create Infrastructure as Code to increase operator productivity and transparency.

 - COLLABORATE & SHARE
   - Terraform configuration can be stored in version control, shared, and collaborated on by teams of operators.

- EVOLVE YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE
  - Track the complete history of infrastructure versions.

- AUTOMATION FRIENDLY
  - If it can be codified, it can be automated.

## Terraform templates

We use Terraform to codify APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.

Templates allow for planing and applying or destroying resources.

## Terraform modules

Terraform module is a container for multiple resources that are used together. Modules can be used to create lightweight abstractions, so that you can describe your infrastructure in terms of its architecture, rather than directly in terms of physical objects.

Currently there are no viable solutions for the web based medical images viewing systems that also run computer aided systems that can diagnose or identify potential problems with the medical images. Even though I mainly focused on the detection using X-ray images this technique can be improved and updated for other techniques such as MRIs and ultrasound images. Current situation is that most of the work is done by a radiologist or a physician for the diagnosis part of the procedure. Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are the systems that are currently in use in countries like Sri lanka. They only provide a way to view the medical images by the radiologist  and do not provide any helpful diagnosis prediction on behalf of the medical practitioner. And PACS solves the problem of having to manually transfer the medical images from the capturing device to the computer that has the viewing software. With the lack of human and technical resources it is vital to get most out of the resources available in hand. Due to this, there should be a mechanism for managing the available medical resources well so that every patient who does need the attention gets it whether they are in a city, town or rural village. 
Detection of bone abnormalities in humans using X-rays is the problem that I am focusing on. It is important because it is overlooked most of the time due to the rarity of a diagnosis event. Most of the time bone abnormalities detection has been diagnosed accidently. I could make every bone X-ray go through a model and automatically inform the radiologist if any irregularities were found about the X-ray. There are several ways for the detection of bone abnormalities such as SVM model and deep learning using CNN model. Most of the models give a relatively similar rate of a prediction of the abnormality. I have to incorporate these models with a view for the radiologist.

## Research Objective

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Objective is to create an image classification model that can identify the bone abnormalities by analyzing X-ray images using state of the art technologies including machine learning and deep learning. This will benefit towards providing health services to the part of the world which suffers from lack of technical resources and medical personnel to provide health services. According to a study on the disease on the world scale say that the bone related conditions affect more than 1.7 billion worldwide. And it also points out that bone released diseases accounted for the 2nd greatest cause of disabilities, and have the 4th greatest impact on the overall health of the world currently. Also X-ray is a widely used medical imaging technique so improving the ability to diagnose X-ray images is quite beneficial for a large part of the under developed or rural areas. Due to that the objective of diagnosing the bone abnormalities using X-ray images is a very important task.

## Commercialization

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
There is no current system in Sri Lankan hospitals to address the issues within
the radiology field. Currently when a patient gets an X-ray it directly goes to the
physician for a special doctor who prescribes it without going through the radiologist.
It goes to the radiologist if the doctor asks for a report regarding the X-ray. Which
makes potential issues with the X-ray that could have been detected through
radiologist goes with any detection. And for the radiologists there needs to be a fully
fledged PACS system and a Viewer that can create a report regarding the X-ray.
Which makes radiologist working time less as he/she needs to in person.
Main customers of the product will be hospitals in Sri Lanka. Especially
private hospitals will be attracted to products rather than their government
counterparts. Detection of bone abnormalities are proposed by this system that can be
sold as a feature that no other system has. That also makes the current PACS more
work with less productivity. This product gives hassle free internet solutions to bulky
PACS in hospitals.
As the system must connect to the internet it would not be possible to host the
system by the hospitals themselves. Because it has to work with standards of internet
41security regarding medical data it should be on a centralized server. So the system
can be sold as two separate stages. The access to the web application as well as
admin panel for image uploading as a one time cost and monthly I can charge the
hospitals for hosting the application and medical images and data.
So, the proposed system will solve a lot of the current issues facing radiology
in Sri Lanka. As the proposed system is a web based system, it can be accessed
through the internet there would be direct access to radiologists medical images. This
type of system can be commercially viable and can be deployed in private hospitals
because that could increase the productivity of their hospital while the system could
also bring down time that patient has to wait. Because private hospitals are always
looking for the quickest and efficient way of working this product would make sense
for them to have rather than not.
